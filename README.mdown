Croogo Docs
===========

Requirements
------------

You can read all of the documentation within as its just in plain text files, marked up with ReST text formatting.  To build the documentation you'll need the following:

* Make
* Python
* Sphinx 1.2.* (currently the make commands will not work with 1.3.* versions and up)
* PhpDomain for sphinx

You can install sphinx using:

	easy_install sphinx==1.2.3

You can install the phpdomain using:

	easy_install sphinxcontrib-phpdomain

Building the documentation
--------------------------

After installing the require packages you can build the documentation using `Make`

	make html

This will generate all the documentation in an html form.  Other output such as 'epub', 'pdf' and 'htmlhelp' are not fully complete at this time.

After making changes to the documentation, you can build the html version of the docs by using `make html` again.  This will build only the html files that have had changes made to them.


Contributing
------------

Contributing to the documentation is pretty simple. There are currently a number of outstanding issues that need to be addressed.  We've tried to flag these with `.. todo::` where possible.  To see all the outstanding todo's add the following to your `config/all.py`

	todo_include_todos = True

After rebuilding the html content, you should see a list of existing todo items at the bottom of the table of contents.

You are also welcome to make and suggestions for new content as commits in a github fork.  Please make any totally new sections in a separate branch.  This makes changes far easier to integrate later on.

Translations
------------

Contributing translations requires that you make a new directory using the two letter name for your language.  As content is translated, directories mirroring the english content should be created with localized content.
